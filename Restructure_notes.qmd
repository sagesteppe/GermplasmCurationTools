## Overview

Consider both eSTZwriter (EW) and safeHavens (sfH) as a continuum. EW for non-empirically developed strategies for bio-banking. sfH as a software used for developing empirical seed zones. POSSIBLY new functionality for EW to select eSTZs for collection prioritization.

Both tools are used to: - Prioritize the collection of a minimal number of collections to meet conservation and/or restoration targets. 
- sfH focuses on neutral genetic variation - Purely computational approach, using pre-existing data sets.
- EW on adaptive genetic variation - Common garden based approach to infer adaptive patterns for restoration across time points

## Software todo - safeHavens

-   Use data product for environmental variables which includes predicted timepoints, e.g. 2050 under SSP X.
-   Ensure we are using spatial cross validation for the glmnet folds

## Possible testing data for manuscript

-   Comparison of how existing biobank collections cover the scenarios generated by sfH.
    -   i.e. fraction of all identified collection areas which are covered under realized collection goals.
-   Comparison of how each of the sfH methods would capture adaptive variation as found from all existing eSTZ data products. \~30 taxa
    -   i.e. fraction of all identified stzs which would be 'collected' in under a total target number of STZs
-   IS THERE A WAY TO COMBINE POP GEN NEUTRAL DATA SETS TO SEE HOW MUCH ALLELIC VARIATION MAY BE COVERED ACROSS A SPECIES RANGE??

## Introduction Structure

The Earth is undergoing a biodiversity crisis with estimates that around 45% of flowering plant species are at risk of extinction (@bachman2024extinct, @isbell2023expert).
Responses to mitigate this loss of taxonomic and genetic diversity include both the preservation of germplasm *ex situ*, and the restoration of natural areas to enhance the preservation of germplasm *in situ*, and a combination thereof (@heywood2017plant, @volis2010quasi, @westwood2021botanic). 
Long term *ex situ* conservation is well underway for species which have had, or are expected to have, their entire habitats removed, or the ecological integrity of which are deteriorating beneath thresholds which can support their populations (@mounce2017ex, @union2012integrated).
Advances in restoration are allowing for the enhancement of degraded natural habitats, supporting the persistence of both relatively abundant, and species threatened with extinction; however the development of native plant propagules for restoration require the stages of collecting genetically representative material (Shriver et al. 2026, ...). 
Hence both restoration and long term conservation rely on seed banks (Wambugu et al. 2023)

A wide number of Biobanks have been developed  (@hay2013advances)... Taking forms from seed banks, living collections, to living meta-collections, however each of these approaches relies fundamentally on the preservation of the species genetic diversity (@westwood2021botanic, @walters2021unique).
Currently implemented approaches include... 
... Each approach is likely to have it's own merit depending on the goals of institutions, the programmes they manage, and the curators whom manage the program, but we suspect that most methods have similar efficiencies and are complementary (@guerrant2014sampling).

... However tooling and integration required to prioritize targets, reduce the possibility of duplicated efforts, and use funding for field operations most effectively (... ... A variety of systems for collection of materials have been proposed formally in the literature, or are in use (@havens2015seed, @hoban2020taxonomic, ) ...
Tools for sampling can help design collection goals and priorities (@wambugu2023role)... Here two tools are detailed, one for biobank curators to help maximize their coverage of a species allelic diversity `safeHavens` and a second to assist quantitative geneticists to produce easily usable empirical seed transfer zone products.
In this manuscript we provide a quick overview of both software packages, describing core functionality.

We further make comparisons to show when/ where the methods for general collections vary, by 1) Describing the structure of XXX biorepository collections relative to the sampling scenarios. 
2) For both common and rare taxa determining how well neutral genetic variation would represented under the various sampling criteria.
3) For common taxa, comparing how well each of various sampling schema would cover the identified adaptive variation documented via empirical seed transfer zones.

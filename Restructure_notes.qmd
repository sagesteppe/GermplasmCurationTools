## People

RCB, Brianna Wieferich, Chris Woolridge?, Jeremy Foster?, Jeremie Fant?

## Overview

## Software todo - safeHavens

-   Use data product for environmental variables which includes predicted timepoints, e.g. 2050 under SSP X.
-   Ensure we are using spatial cross validation for the glmnet folds

## Possible testing data for manuscript

-   Comparison of how existing biobank collections cover the scenarios generated by sfH.
    -   i.e. fraction of all identified collection areas which are covered under realized collection goals.
    
    - approach
      - DNTP collections, restrict to species present in Illinois (i.e. focal species, not peripheral)
      - coord scrubs should be fine w/in 5 miles. 
      - 
      
      
-   Comparison of how each of the sfH methods would capture adaptive variation as found from all existing eSTZ data products. \~30 taxa
    -   i.e. fraction of all identified stzs which would be 'collected' in under a total target number of STZs
-   IS THERE A WAY TO COMBINE POP GEN NEUTRAL DATA SETS TO SEE HOW MUCH ALLELIC VARIATION MAY BE COVERED ACROSS A SPECIES RANGE??

## Introduction Structure

The Earth is experiencing a mass extinction event with estimates suggesting 45% of flowering plant species are at risk of extinction (@bachman2024extinct, @isbell2023expert).
Two recent responses to mitigate this loss of taxonomic and genetic diversity include the preservation of plant genetic materials (hereafter germplasm) in *ex situ* collections, and the restoration of natural areas to enhance the preservation of populations *in situ* (@heywood2017plant, @volis2010quasi, @westwood2021botanic). 
Long-term *ex situ* conservation is used when a species has, or is expected to experience, the loss or degradation of their habitat beneath thresholds that can support the species persistence in the wild (@mounce2017ex, @union2012integrated, @TADDEO).
Ecological restoration has become a tool to enhance the habitat quality in natural areas, or to convert land back to natural areas to provide connectivity between higher quality parcels, helping to preserve plant and other biodiversity *in situ*.
However, analogously to *ex situ* conservation - albeit on a different time scale, the development of native plant propagules for ecological restoration requires the collection, and human amplification of germplasm to the required amounts off site (SHRIVER et al. 2026, @wambugu2023role). 

Central to attaining meaningful germplasm collections is the acquisition of adequate amounts of genetic diversity for the conservation of a species for *ex situ* or of populations or groups of populations for restoration (@walters2021unique, @SHRIVER). 
Approaches for collecting germplasm from wild species for *ex situ* conservation and *in situ* restoration projects in use by the nearly 1750 seed banks globally often follows a set of minimal rule-of-thumb guidelines developed from agricultural and population genetics studies (@hay2013advances, @westwood2021botanic). 
Currently, guidance exists for the number of propagules that can be collected to safeguard the persistence of natural population (i.e. avoid over-harvesting), the minimum number of individuals that need to be sampled per population, the number of populations to sample per species to reach genetic diversity targets, and guidance on the geographic structure of where to move restoration collections to and from to avoid using maladapted phenotypes at a restoration site (@CITE, @CITE, @CITE).
However, a variety of goals exist at the institutional, programmatic, and bio-regional organizational levels, as well as opinions among curators, which have fostered tailored strategies beyond the rule-of-thumb guidelines (@guerrant2014sampling).
Further, these minimal guidelines do not guarantee alignment or achievement of goals for all observed species and population genetic structures, or population vital rates, because of nuances in the biology and ecology of individual species (@bucharova2025assessing, @hofner2025spatial). 

However the germplasm collections desired for *ex situ* conservation and ecological restoration differ in a key attribute. 
*Ex situ* germplasm collections aim to maximize coverage of neutral genetic variation, the material which allows evolution a wide array of phenotypes to act upon, following the logic that no set of phenotypes are universally most fit. 
Restoration collections, on the other hand, seek to maximize chances of restoration success at sites in a defined focal area and time, and seeks to identify populations with the highest chance of doing so, while maintaining some allelic diversity for at site selection to occur.   

Here we present two software tools to help curators refine and implement their collection goals, using free and open source software (FOSS). 
The first tool `safeHavens`, global in coverage, aims to maximize the putative coverage of neutral genetic variation across a species range using proxies: 1) geographic, 2) ecoregional, 3) environmental coverage of `ex situ` and restorations collections in areas lacking defined seed transfer zones, or where seed zones transfer zones may not align with the goals of restoration collections.
The second tool, tailored to the Western United States, `eSTZwriter` assists quantitative geneticists in producing standardized spatial data products describing areas for targeted seed collection and restoration planting which may be readily used by curators.

We further make comparisons to show when / where the methods for general collections vary, 
by 1) Describing the structure of XXX biorepository collections relative to the sampling scenarios. 
2) For both common and rare taxa determining how well neutral genetic variation would represented under the various sampling criteria.
3) For common taxa, comparing how well each of various sampling schema would cover the identified adaptive variation documented via empirical seed transfer zones.
